## Description
Genotype-corrector is a useful tool to correct genotype calls for individuals
from RILs with the goal to improve genetic mapping.It is based on a sliding
window approach to correct noisy genotype calls and complete missing data,
which both have a significant impact on the reconstructed maps. Genotype-Corrector
is useful for those who want to use SNPs genotype as the population markers
to construct genetic mapping using next generation sequencing with relative
low sequence coverage.
