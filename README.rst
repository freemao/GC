Overview of Genotype-corrector
================================
Genotype-corrector is a useful tool to correct genotype calls for individuals from RILs with the goal
to improve genetic mapping.It is based on a sliding window approach to correct noisy genotype
calls and complete missing data, which both have a significant impact on the reconstructed maps.
Genotype-Corrector is useful for those who want to use SNPs genotype as the population
markers to construct genetic mapping using next generation sequencing with relative
low sequence coverage.
